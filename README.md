## INTRODUCTION
 We tried to create the game of Wordle, but with food names only. The app is created in React and is a similar copy of the popular game of Wordle. The Name comes from `Food` + `Wordle` = `Foodle`. Hope you all enjoy the game.

 * One each try, if you guess a letter at correct position, the letter will be highlighted in green.
 * On each try, if you guess a letter belonging to the word, but not on correct position, it will be highlighted in Yellow.
 * Brainstorm all the possiblities, create all the possible permutations and combinations, and predict the word before try count runs out. All the best.
